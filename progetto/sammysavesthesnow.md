# Sammy Saves the Snow: A Fun Story About Climate Change
<div align="center">
Once upon a time, in a land of ice and snow,
Lived a polar bear named Sammy, who loved to play and go,
He slid on the ice and caught some fish, then snuggled up and slept,
But Sammy soon found out, that the snow he loved to kept,
Was melting way too fast, and the ice was breaking thin,
Sammy wondered why, the Earth was heating up within.

Sammy asked his friends, the seals and walruses too,
They said the Earth was changing, and it was up to me and you,
To take care of the planet, and make it a better place,
To stop using so much energy, and start to set the pace,
For others to follow, and make a difference every day,
To save the snow and ice, and keep the Earth from going astray.

So Sammy went on a journey, with his friends by his side,
They traveled all around the world, and saw what they could abide,
They saw windmills and solar panels, and ways to use less heat,
They turned off lights and unplugged things, when they weren't needed or neat,
They talked to lots of people, who cared about the Earth too,
And learned that everyone, can help to make things new.

When Sammy and his friends, returned to the Arctic land,
They saw the ice was still melting, and that wasn't so grand,
But they also saw some changes, people were making every day,
To help the Earth and animals, in every little way,
They felt happy and hopeful, knowing that they had done some good,
And that they had made a difference, in their neighborhood.

From that day on, Sammy worked, to keep the snow and ice from melting,
He taught other animals and people, about the things worth felting,
About taking care of the Earth, and making it a better place,
About the power of small actions, and how they can leave a trace,
Sammy knew that the Earth, was a special and precious land,
And he worked hard every day, to lend a helping hand.

So Sammy saves the snow, and the ice that he loves to play,
He saves it for his friends and family, and for every other day,
He knows that with our help, we can all make a change,
And keep the Earth healthy and happy, for every single range.

The end.
